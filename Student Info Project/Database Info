Student Database Project
This project demonstrates how to create a simple database that stores student information such as ID, Name, Age, and Grade.

Steps to Create the Database
Set up a Database
You can use any database management system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, etc.). Below are the steps for setting up a basic student database:

Fields:
ID: A unique identifier for each student (Primary Key).
Name: The full name of the student.
Age: The student's age.
Grade: The student's grade or class level.

Populate the Database
You can manually insert student data into the table using SQL queries or automate it with a backend programming language like Python.
